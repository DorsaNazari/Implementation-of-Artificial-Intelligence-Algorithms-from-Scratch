# Implementation-of-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms-from-Scratch

I implemented some Neural Networks algorithms from scratch for my computational inteligence lab.
including : 
Single Layer Perceptron(SLP) and Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP)
K-means algorithm
K nearest neighbours (KNN)
Redial basis neural network (RBNN)
Hopfield neural network
